# Multimodal RAG Solution Summary

## Problem Statement
You wanted to enhance your existing RAG system to process both PDF text and images for contextual reasoning and QA. The challenge was to pass both extracted images and PDF text to the LLM to get better responses when asking specific questions about development plans and maps.

## Solution Overview
I've enhanced your existing system to create a **multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** solution that:

1. **Extracts images** from PDFs based on relevant keywords
2. **Analyzes images** using Gemini Vision to generate detailed textual descriptions
3. **Combines** text and image descriptions in a unified vector store
4. **Retrieves** both textual and visual information for comprehensive answers

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. **New Image Analysis Functions**
```python
def analyze_image_with_gemini(image_path: str, context_prompt: str = None) -> str:
    """Analyze image using Gemini Vision and return detailed description"""
```
- Uses Gemini Vision (gemini-2.5-flash) to analyze extracted images
- Generates comprehensive descriptions focusing on layout, annotations, spatial relationships
- Context-aware prompts for development plans and mapping documents

### 2. **Enhanced Document Processing**
```python
def process_images_to_documents(image_paths: List[str], pdf_path: str) -> List[Document]:
    """Process images using Gemini Vision and convert descriptions to LangChain Documents"""
```
- Converts image analysis results into searchable LangChain Documents
- Preserves metadata (source, page, filename) for proper attribution
- Creates rich textual descriptions of visual content

### 3. **Multimodal Vector Store**
```python
def create_vector_store(docs: List[Document], embeddings):
    """Create vector store from documents (both text and image descriptions)"""
```
- Handles both text chunks and image descriptions differently
- Preserves image analysis context by not chunking image descriptions
- Retrieves top 7 results (increased from 5) for better coverage

### 4. **Enhanced Prompt Template**
```python
MULTIMODAL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. 
The context may include both text content and image analysis descriptions.

When image analysis is provided, it will be clearly marked as "IMAGE ANALYSIS"...
"""
```
- Specifically designed to handle multimodal content
- Instructs the LLM to pay attention to visual elements
- Integrates text and image information effectively

## How It Works

### Step 1: Image Extraction
```python
def extract_images_from_pdf(pdf_path: str, image_output_dir: str):
```
- Scans PDF pages for keywords: 'zoning', 'plan', 'layout', 'structure', 'development', 'site'
- Filters images by size (min 500x500) and aspect ratio (0.5-2.0)
- Extracts and saves relevant images to local directory

### Step 2: Vision Analysis
```python
# For each extracted image
description = analyze_image_with_gemini(image_path, context_prompt)
```
- Analyzes each image with Gemini Vision
- Generates detailed descriptions including:
  - Visual elements and layout
  - Text, labels, and annotations
  - Spatial relationships
  - Technical diagrams and plans

### Step 3: Document Creation
```python
doc = Document(
    page_content=f"IMAGE ANALYSIS - {filename}:\n{description}",
    metadata={
        "source": pdf_path,
        "image_path": image_path,
        "page": page_num,
        "type": "image_analysis",
        "filename": filename
    }
)
```
- Creates LangChain Documents from image descriptions
- Adds comprehensive metadata for tracking and attribution

### Step 4: Unified Vector Store
- Combines text chunks and image descriptions
- Uses FAISS for efficient similarity search
- Retrieves both textual and visual information together

### Step 5: Enhanced Query Processing
```python
def query_system(query: str, qa_chain):
    """Enhanced query system that can handle multimodal context"""
```
- Processes queries against both text and image content
- Provides source attribution for both text and images
- Returns comprehensive answers leveraging both modalities

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from model import get_qa_chain, query_system

# Initialize the multimodal QA system
qa_chain = get_qa_chain("your_pdf_file.pdf")

# Ask questions that benefit from both text and images
query = "Can you analyze the plans in the Mithuri Centre Base Map alone, provide the status of the plan"
result = query_system(query, qa_chain)
print(result)
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run the test script
python3 test_multimodal.py

# Run the example usage
python3 example_usage.py
```

## Key Benefits

### ✅ **Visual Understanding**
- Analyzes diagrams, maps, and technical drawings
- Understands spatial relationships and layouts
- Processes visual annotations and labels

### ✅ **Complete Context**
- Combines textual descriptions with visual analysis
- Maintains relationships between text and images
- Provides comprehensive document understanding

### ✅ **Better Accuracy**
- More accurate answers for technical documents
- Can reference specific visual elements
- Understands both explicit text and implicit visual information

### ✅ **Rich Responses**
- Detailed analysis of visual elements
- Source attribution for both text and images
- Context-aware answers that leverage both modalities

## Configuration Notes

### Image Filtering
- **Keywords**: 'zoning', 'plan', 'layout', 'structure', 'development', 'site'
- **Minimum size**: 500x500 pixels
- **Aspect ratio**: 0.5 to 2.0

### Model Configuration
- **LLM**: gemini-2.5-flash (for text processing)
- **Vision**: gemini-2.5-flash (for image analysis)
- **Embeddings**: text-embedding-004

### Vector Store Settings
- **Chunk size**: 10,000 characters
- **Chunk overlap**: 200 characters
- **Retrieval**: Top 7 results
- **Image descriptions**: No chunking (preserve context)

## Important Considerations

1. **API Costs**: Image analysis uses Vision API calls - monitor usage
2. **Processing Time**: Initial setup takes longer due to image analysis
3. **Image Quality**: Better image quality = better analysis results
4. **Customization**: Adjust keywords and filters for your specific domain

## Next Steps

To use this enhanced system:

1. Set your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in a `.env` file
2. Run `python3 test_multimodal.py` to test the system
3. Use `python3 example_usage.py` for your specific use case
4. Customize keywords and prompts for your domain

Your original query about analyzing the Mithuri Centre Base Map will now receive much richer responses that combine both textual information and detailed visual analysis of the actual plans and maps in the PDF.
